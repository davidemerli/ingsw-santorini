# Santorini

> Santorini is an **accessible strategy game**, **simple** enough for an elementary school classroom **while aiming to provide gameplay depth** and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. <u>Each turn consists of 2 steps</u>:
>
> **1. Move** - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.
>
> **2. Build** - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.
>
> **Winning the game** - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.
>
> **Variable player powers** - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played.
